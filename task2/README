Compilation command:
	g++ -std=c++11 -I /usr/local/include -L /usr/local/lib select.cpp -lsdsl -ldivsufsort -ldivsufsort64
Running command (this will generate necessary data for plotting):
	./a.out

Instruction for using the code:
First, you should initiate bit_vector `b` of size `N` with this command:
        sdsl::bit_vector b(N, 0);
Then, you can create an instance of rank_support:
        rank_support r(&b);
And after that, you create an instance of select_support:
        select_support s(&r);
Now, you can call `s(i)` or `r.select1(i)` to get the first index with rank of i.
Also, you can call `s.overhead()` to get the number of extra bits in our `select_support` structure.
The `overhead()` function does not count the bit_vector `b`. It just calculate extra bits which are `rs` and `rb`.
At the end, you can use `s.save(fname)` and `s.load(fname)` to save and load a `select_support` instance into `fname` file.

Extra information about main():
In the `main()` function, there is a commented section which is an example for using the `select_support` structure.
After this part, you could see the code that generates data for plotting. I put its output into `data_for_plot` file.
